Railcraft mainline development for 1.12 is in hiatus, and there are bugs to be fixed.

So here it is.

As of now, it:

- Fixes custom rolling machine recipes with certain size being incorrectly displayed in JEI.
  (Railcraft/Railcraft#2120)
- Aggressively fixes FPS drop when some Railcraft machines are running, e.g. boiler.
  (Railcraft/Railcraft#2121)
- Allows worldspike to stack fuels to item's own maximum stack size
  (Railcraft/Railcraft#2082)
- Fixes some outfitted track GUIs showing raw translation key as title
  (Railcraft/Railcraft#2097)
- Fixes crash upon opening GUI of RF Loader / Unloader, making them usable
  (Railcraft/Railcraft#2098)
- Fixes "Carts" label flying out of window in Activator Track GUI
- Fixes crashes when breaking bottom layer of a completed water tank

- Fixes Steam Turbine not forming when using IC2Classic
  (Railcraft/Railcraft#2040 - courtesy of Speiger)
- Fixes tooltips are not shown in Steel Anvil GUI
  (Railcraft/Railcraft#2093 - courtesy of ACGaming)
- Provide alternative recipes for electrodes, allowing inputs to be in any column
  (3TUSK/RailwayDeoptWorker#1)

This mod works in Minecraft 1.12.2 ONLY.

This mod works with either the original Railcraft, or ACGaming's fork.

This mod, along with its source, is released in public domain.
You can certainly use it in modpacks.

TODO

- Figure out the intended behavior when using Crowbar on Delayed Locking track.
  Current behavior is switching mode, i.e. same as Locking track.
  However such behavior makes the Delayed Locking track GUI inaccssible.

- Un-crafting Cargo Cart gives back Trapped Chest, not Redstone Comparator.

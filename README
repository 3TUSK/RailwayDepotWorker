Railcraft mainline development for 1.12 is in hiatus, and there are bugs to be fixed.

So here it is.

As of now, it:

- Fixes custom rolling machine recipes with certain size being incorrectly displayed in JEI.
- Aggressively fixes FPS drop when some Railcraft machines are running, e.g. boiler.

This mod works in Minecraft 1.12.2 ONLY.

This mod works with either the original Railcraft, or ACGaming's fork.

This mod, along with its source, is released in public domain.
You can certainly use it in modpacks.
